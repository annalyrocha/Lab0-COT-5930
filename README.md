## Notes

During the development of the student introduction app, two key challenges were encountered. The first challenge involved ensuring that the `morePetsSwitch` accurately reflected the user's intent in the introduction message, preventing any potential confusion. The second challenge was creating a responsive user interface that worked well across various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.
